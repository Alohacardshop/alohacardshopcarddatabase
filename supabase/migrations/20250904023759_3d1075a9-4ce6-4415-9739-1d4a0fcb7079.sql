According to Supabase instructions, I should review the existing configuration and check the row-level security (RLS) settings—none mentioned for the ops.pricing_job_runs table. It seems like we might need to create a new RPC function to handle cancellation requests since edge functions can't execute raw SQL directly." duration="4.607673">

I’m thinking about how the service role key typically allows access in edge functions. It seems these functions often initialize the Supabase client using the SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY. That’s standard, but since edge functions can’t execute raw SQL, they should use 'supabase.rpc' or 'supabase.from' to interact with data. While I can specify the 'ops.pricing_job_runs' table, Supabase expects public access by default. To be cautious, I’ll suggest creating a public table called \"pricing_job_controls\" with fields for job ID, cancellation status, and some additional details." duration="3.721419">

I’m considering whether to add Row Level Security (RLS) for admin usage since the admin UI probably uses the service key while the client side uses the anonymous key. I can provide a security definer RPC called \"request_pricing_job_cancel(job_id uuid)\" to manage the cancel flag, keeping the table secure. The edge function should be able to check cancellation through RPCs in the public schema, like \"is_pricing_job_cancelled(job_id uuid).\" I also want to add a \"force_finish_pricing_job\" RPC for marking job statuses, but I'm cautious about unresponsive functions due to API errors." duration="4.205799">

I’m thinking about how to check for cancellations before each batch in our process since the code already loops through batches and logs progress. We can't change the code in chat mode, but I can propose a plan for the user to implement later. Additionally, I want to include a cleanup migration or RPC to mark jobs running longer than X minutes as errors. I should also design a function called \"cancel_stuck_pricing_jobs(max_minutes int default 60)\" that can be triggered by the UI or scheduled. The user also wants a UI redesign, so I’ll need to gather earlier logs to propose a plan for that while prioritizing the Force Stop feature first.

</lov-tool-use>
Great idea — let’s add a Force Stop so jobs can be cancelled mid-run and clean up anything that’s stuck.

What’s happening now
- The pricing function doesn’t check for cancellation, so it will keep iterating batches even if we want it to stop.
- If the function dies before it calls finish_pricing_job_run, the job stays “running.”
- There is no periodic “heartbeat” to update progress, so the UI may show “running” without reliable mid-run metrics.

What we’ll add
- A cancel control table and RPCs to:
  - Request a cancellation for a specific job.
  - Let the edge function check “is this job cancelled?” before each batch and exit gracefully as “cancelled.”
  - Update progress during the run (heartbeat).
  - Clean up stuck jobs older than N minutes.
- UI changes on /admin/pricing:
  - Add a “Force Stop” action on active jobs (with confirm dialog).
  - Show “Cancel requested” state.
  - Add “Clean up stuck runs” action to mark long-running jobs as error.

lov-plan
1) Database and RPCs
- Create public.pricing_job_control to track cancel requests.
- Add RPCs:
  - request_pricing_job_cancel(job_id, reason?) to flip cancel_requested=true (SECURITY DEFINER).
  - is_pricing_job_cancelled(job_id) returns boolean.
  - update_pricing_job_progress(job_id, actual_batches, cards_processed, variants_updated).
  - cancel_stuck_pricing_jobs(max_minutes default 60) to mark old running jobs as error, return number updated.

2) Edge function: justtcg-refresh-variants
- Before each batch:
  - Call is_pricing_job_cancelled; if true, call finish_pricing_job_run with status='cancelled' and return early.
- After each batch:
  - Call update_pricing_job_progress to write heartbeat/progress.
- Keep improved JustTCG auth and error logging already in place.

3) UI: /admin/pricing
- Add “Force Stop” button per active job row; show confirm dialog; call request_pricing_job_cancel(jobId).
- Show inline “Cancel requested” badge on the job row when a cancel is requested.
- Add a “Clean up stuck runs” action in the page header that calls cancel_stuck_pricing_jobs(60).
- Adaptive polling: 5s while any job is running/cancel requested, 30s otherwise. Keep “Refresh” keyboard shortcut (R) and descriptive toasts.

4) Recovery for current stuck job(s)
- Once SQL and code are deployed, use “Force Stop” or “Clean up stuck runs” to immediately change stuck jobs from running → cancelled/error.
